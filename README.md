# ArmyCreator

This tool should help to create army lists for the Hobbit Tabletop Game by Games Workshop.

You need Python3, sqlite3 and Gtk+3 to run it.
I only tested it for Linux.
To install the dependencies under Ubuntu do:
```
sudo apt-get install python3 sqlite3
```

Gtk+3.0 should be installed per default.
Users of other linux distros should know how to get those packages for themselves ;)

To run, simply do:
```
python3 Main.py
```

or whatever the command for your python3 is.
```python3``` is default under Ubuntu.

# Profiles

Since I am not allowed to publish any rules or profiles, you need to create a database of profiles on your own.
You may use tools like http://sqlitebrowser.org/.

The empty database file ```database.db``` is already there, you just have to fill it out.
